# Personal-Site

Things I learned
      - CSS properties and gained familiarity
      -how to code in JS
      -that the foundations of a site need to be laid properly or it will be hard to fix things when they mess up later on
      -how to use simple API's and JS libraries
      -photos need to be resized if you want the site speed to be devent
      -sizing elements properly and the importance of doing that (typer moved all elements below it)
      -navbars... was a whole ordeal and I almost gave up
